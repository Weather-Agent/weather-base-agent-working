# Earthquake Agent Enhancements

## Analysis of USGS Earthquake API Features

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the USGS Earthquake API documentation, here are the enhanced features added to your earthquake monitoring project:

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Query Parameters

#### **Magnitude Filtering**
- `min_magnitude` and `max_magnitude` - Complete magnitude range control
- Better precision for targeting specific earthquake severities

#### **Depth Filtering** 
- `min_depth` and `max_depth` - Filter earthquakes by depth range (0-1000km)
- Critical for understanding earthquake types:
  - Shallow (0-35km): More surface damage
  - Intermediate (35-70km): Moderate effects  
  - Deep (70km+): Reduced surface impact

#### **Data Quality Filters**
- `max_gap` - Maximum azimuthal gap (data quality indicator)
- `review_status` - Filter by automatic vs reviewed data
- `include_all_magnitudes` - Get all magnitude estimates vs preferred only

#### **Alert and Impact Filters**
- `alert_level` - PAGER alert levels (green/yellow/orange/red)
- `min_felt` - Minimum "Did You Feel It?" reports
- `event_type` - Filter specific event types

#### **Product Integration**
- `product_type` - Access to:
  - ShakeMap intensity maps
  - DYFI community reports
  - PAGER economic loss estimates
  - Moment tensor solutions
  - Focal mechanism data

### 2. Enhanced Data Fields

Your earthquake events now include:

#### **Quality Metrics**
```python
"data_quality": {
    "gap": 45.2,           # Azimuthal gap in degrees
    "rms": 0.15,           # RMS travel time residual  
    "net": "us",           # Reporting network
    "nst": 124,            # Number of seismic stations
    "dmin": 0.084          # Distance to nearest station
}
```

#### **Impact Metrics**
```python
"impact_metrics": {
    "cdi": 6.8,            # Community Determined Intensity
    "mmi": 7.2,            # Modified Mercalli Intensity
    "felt": 1247,          # Number of felt reports
    "updated": timestamp   # Last update time
}
```

#### **Event Identification**
```python
"event_ids": {
    "usgs_id": "us70012345",
    "code": "70012345", 
    "ids": ["us70012345", "nc73456789"]  # All network IDs
}
```

### 3. New Functions Added

#### **`get_earthquake_data_advanced()`**
- Comprehensive filtering with all USGS API parameters
- Enhanced data quality analysis
- Magnitude distribution statistics
- Impact assessment integration

#### **`get_earthquake_count()`**
- Quick statistics without full data retrieval
- Uses USGS count endpoint for efficiency
- Perfect for monitoring trends

#### **`get_significant_earthquakes()`**
- Automated significance scoring
- Impact assessment for each event
- Global monitoring of major events
- Countries affected analysis

#### **Quality Analysis Functions**
- `_analyze_data_quality()` - Data reliability metrics
- `_calculate_significance_score()` - Custom significance algorithm
- `_assess_earthquake_impact()` - Comprehensive impact evaluation
- `_estimate_affected_radius()` - Geographic impact estimation

### 4. Enhanced Risk Assessment

#### **Significance Scoring Algorithm**
Combines multiple factors:
- Magnitude (exponential weight)
- Community felt reports
- USGS significance value
- Depth factor (shallower = higher impact)

#### **Impact Assessment Categories**
- **Catastrophic** (8.0+): Major destruction, international aid
- **Severe** (7.0-7.9): Serious infrastructure damage
- **Moderate to Strong** (6.0-6.9): Building damage possible
- **Light to Moderate** (5.0-5.9): Widely felt, minor damage
- **Minimal** (<5.0): Generally not felt

### 5. Data Quality Features

#### **Review Status Tracking**
- Percentage of reviewed vs automatic events
- Data reliability indicators
- Quality score distributions

#### **Statistical Analysis**
- Magnitude distribution histograms
- Average data quality metrics
- Community engagement levels (felt reports)

## Potential Additional Enhancements

### 1. **Visualization Integration**
- KML output for Google Earth
- CSV export for data analysis
- Real-time mapping capabilities

### 2. **Advanced Geographic Features**
```python
def get_earthquake_data_rectangle(
    min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon
):
    """Search within rectangular regions"""
```

### 3. **Historical Analysis**
- Long-term trend analysis
- Seasonal pattern detection
- Comparative regional studies

### 4. **Real-time Monitoring**
```python
def setup_earthquake_monitoring(
    location, magnitude_threshold, 
    notification_callback
):
    """Continuous monitoring with alerts"""
```

### 5. **Integration with Other APIs**
- Population density data for impact assessment
- Infrastructure databases for damage estimation
- Social media sentiment analysis during events

## Usage Examples

### Basic Advanced Search
```python
# Get moderate earthquakes with good data quality
data = get_earthquake_data_advanced(
    min_magnitude=4.0,
    max_magnitude=6.0,
    days_back=7,
    max_gap=90,  # Good azimuthal coverage
    review_status="reviewed",  # Only reviewed data
    city="Los Angeles",
    radius_km=200
)
```

### Significant Events Monitoring  
```python
# Monitor global significant events
significant = get_significant_earthquakes(
    days_back=7,
    min_magnitude=5.5
)
```

### Quick Statistics
```python
# Fast event counting
count = get_earthquake_count(
    min_magnitude=3.0,
    days_back=30,
    city="Tokyo",
    radius_km=100
)
```

## Benefits of These Enhancements
